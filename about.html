I have one of the best relationships with each member individually. I could be considered the connecting piece for all of them. Being child number 5 out of 8, I was able to grow up in the middle of this amazing family. I am grateful for the knowledge that I have of eternal families and the blessings that come from the Gospel of Jesus Christ. As you can see, I have two older sisters, two older brothers, and then three younger sisters.

                            My oldest sister has blessed me with a niece and a nephew whom are both loved a lot!

I served in the Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua, Mexico Mission during the years of August 2017 to July 2019. It is a place that definitely has my heart even though I was born in Colorado.I had the great opportunity to go back and visit a part of my mission this past July 2021, and it was a special thing to be able to see some of the great people that I met while I was serving the Lord. I wouldnt change it for anything in the world, and if asked to do it again, I would in a heartbeat! Viva Mexico!!</p></div>

Being one of the fastest growing sports in the world, it has definitely become something that is apart of my blood. There is nothing better than being in the game, and having your adrenaline pumping through your veins as you are in combat against the opposing team trying to score a goal.
                            <br/>
                            Another thing that I love to do is be outdoors and active doing something. I love nature so much and it has become a huge part of my life. Its always a good thing to take a chance and escape for a little bit. Even more so when you get to do it with family or friends.
